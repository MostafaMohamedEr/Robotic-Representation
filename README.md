# Robotic-Representation
The proposed code is an implementation of robotic system that consists of 3 material components and a virtual component.
The environment contains a robot, number of objects, number of goals locations that is equaled to number of objects and number of blocks.
the code allows the user to select the numbers of objects, goals locations and obstacles, as the user wants.
The objective of the code is giving instructions to the robot to move the objects from their locations to another locations.
The code is generalized to deal with any given scenario and possible problems.
## The algorithm
BFS is used to find the paths
## TKinter
The code is visualized using Python tKinter GUI
